\begin{abstract}
The 2020 Southwest U.S. drought was the driest summer of the instrumented record and part of a 20-year megadrought with severe consequences for water resources. Despite biases in the fully coupled CESM2, we were able to reproduce observed precipitation in a constrained circulation framework, by nudging the large scale circulation to reanalysis winds. Previous work has attributed the precipitation anomalies primarily to natural variability as opposed to radiative forcing or warming. We ported the 2020 circulation pattern to past and future climates to understand if warming influences monsoon period precipitation. Ensemble mean precipitation was 4mm higher under pre-industrial conditions, which is relatively small compared to the 2020 drought anomaly of -66mm, confirming that warming was at most a small contributor to monsoon failure. Ensemble mean precipitation was another 9mm lower under end-of-century conditions, indicating that future warming could further exacerbate Southwest U.S. droughts. However, we found that our future conditions constrained circulation ensemble was significantly drier than any simulations in a fully coupled framework, indicating that large-scale feedbacks may disallow this circulation pattern in the future.

\section{Introduction}



Coupled ESMs have not captured humidity trends in semi-arid ecosystems \cite{simpson2024}.

Though ESMs show a slight increase in spring precipitation in the region, there does not seem to be an attributable influence of climate change on NAM precipitation. Previous work indicates that the 2020 SWUS drought was not exacerbated by climate change, but was rather a result of  internal atmospheric variability \cite{seager2022}. 

\section{Methods}

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Simulating the 2020 SWUS drought}

\subsection{Porting the 2020 circulation to past and future climates}

\subsection{Similarities and differences between the CCE and the CESM2-LE}
ET$\sim$SM looks the same. But P$\sim$ET looks a bit different. The CCE mean looks to be in a reasonable spot, roughly speaking, but the partial response of P to varying ET (via land initialization) looks much smaller than in the fully coupled model. This would seem to indicate that the coupling of SM->ET is agnostic to the broader circulation, whereas P is not simply determined by the local ET. In the coupled model we tend to see an 18mm reduction in P for a 10mm reduction in ET, but in the CCE it looks more like 5mm P per 10mm ET. In the coupled model the circulation associated with 140mm ET may be quite different from the circulation that results in 120mm ET, in addition to any differences in the initial conditions. In the CCE, only the initial conditions are different, and the large-scale circulation is following observations. When CCE goes from ET of 120 to 100, the broader circulation still provides a relatively equivalent flux of water to the region (in fact slightly higher), which helps support the precipitation from falling drastically. In the coupled model, when ET goes from 140 to 120mm, it is probably largely driven by a change to a more diverging circulation, whereby the precip is robbed of the convergence flux as well as the associated reductions in ET flux. 

Does this invalidate inference from the CCE? No, it just means that any takeaways are conditional to the given circulation pattern. In the case of understanding sensitivity to initial conditions in the 2020 ensemble, the experimental framework is probably quite helpful. In the case of the analogue simulations, it's slightly more complicated, because warmer or colder climates may not be able to develop this circulation pattern. Towards this end, the fact that the 2090 ensemble is so much drier than anything seen in the fully coupled model is hard to overlook. This would seem to indicate that CESM2 predicts changes in circulation that would disallow the droughts we are simulating in the 2090 CCE. Further work to understand the mechanisms underpinning may be interesting, especially given the tendency across many coupled models to produce aberrant VP trends in semi-arid ecosystems. 


Why is the CCE drier than the LE in 2090?

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:

% Break each line at a sign of operation

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER

% You may change equation numbering by resetting

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}

% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
